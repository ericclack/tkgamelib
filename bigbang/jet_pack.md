Big Bang Fair demo - Jet Pack

TO DO:
- No aliens during take off
- Better sprites, especially main character + aliens
- Place platforms in better places
- Fuel look better on rocket
- Take off results in next level (faster current level?)

Test:
- Miss rocket, delete flames
- Take off w sprite = next level
- Take off w sprite = repeat level

Done:
- Aliens appear at RHS of screen too
- Introduce bugs or remove features
- Print score to console so can record on chart

Bugs to fix at BigBang:
- Platforms in the wrong place  (160,200, 700,250),
- Reversed controls
- Too many aliens
