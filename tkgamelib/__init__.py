"""Simple to learn games library for people new to Python, as seen at
Coder Dojo and STEM school visits. Runs on default Python install.

Inspired by MIT Scratch and PygameZero, answers the question "what
should I try after Scratch?"

PygameZero is really cool, but it requires extra libraries to be
installed so isn't an option in some organisations such as
schools. TKGameLib works on the default Python, it uses TKinter for
graphics, sprites etc, and is designed to encourage exploration of
everything.

See examples in the folder examples, or more info on github.com:
