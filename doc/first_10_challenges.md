# GeekClub First 10 Challenges

## Make the Pong game better...

### 1. Fix the bat

Start with `pong2.py`:

The game is too easy, make it harder by stopping the bat from moving
up and down.


### 2. Fix the ball

Start with `pong2.py`:

Sometimes the ball only moves on one axis (so left/right or up/down)
and occassionally it doesn't move at all. Fix this.


### 3. Get all the bricks

Start with `pong3.py`:

Right now to the next level you only need to get the ball to the top
of the screen. Change it so that you need to get all the bricks before
getting onto the next level.

## Improve the Asteroids game...

### 1. Slow down

Start with `asteroids1.py`:

Right now you can speed up but not slow down, fix this.

### 2. The ship has crashed

Start with `asteroids2.py`

The ship is invincible, and can fly through asteroids. Fix this so
that if the ship touches an asteroid a life is lost, or the game ends.

### 3. Fragments of rock

Start with `asteroids2.py`

When you shoot an asteroid, currently it disappears, replace it with two smaller ones instead.
