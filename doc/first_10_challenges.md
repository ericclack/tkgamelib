# GeekClub First 10 Challenges

## Make the Pong game better...

1. Fix the bat

Start with `pong2.py`:

The game is too easy, make it harder by stopping the bat from moving up and down.


2. Fix the ball

Start with `pong2.py`:

Sometimes the ball only moves on one axis (so left/right or up/down) and occassionally it doesn't move at all. Fix this. 


3. Get all the bricks

Start with `pong3.py`:

Right now you get to the next level once the ball gets to the top of the screen. Change it so
that you need to get all the bricks before getting onto the next level. 


(Versions 2 and 3 are too similar, version 4 too complex?)
